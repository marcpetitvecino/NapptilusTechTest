Libraries that I used in this project:

Picasso: For loading image urls into ImageViews, it also automatically caches images for better performance

Retrofit2: It's the first library that I started to use to get API data, so it's the one I trust the most

Retrofit2 converter gson: To convert the JSON data into code

Kotlinx Coroutines: To make async requests so the UI doesn't get blocked

Logging Interceptor: To get API logs when debugging
